# bots

This repo contains all of my currently publicly available twitch bots which have been created with the TMI.JS library.

	Bots
1. autoBanBot
This bot allows a user to have a multiple channel ban system.
It allows a broadcaster of a channel to become part of a network of sorts where if a broadcaster uses a custom command e.g. !multiban userName reason then that user will be banned across all channels that have been included.
