This file contains instructions on how to get up and running with the autoBanBot

1. create a new twitch account which the bot can use or use your own.
2. Go to https://twitchapps.com/tmi/ in order to generate an oaurth token for the account.
Note: You will also need to do this if you are useing your own account.
3. Put the username and the oaurth token in there respective fields inside of the autoBanBot.js file
Example:

	identity: {
		username: 'put your username here and do not remove the ' surounding it',
		password: 'Put the oauth token here and do not remove the ' surounding it'
	},

4. Fill out the list of channels you want the bot to opporate in remembering to add a , at the end of each after the ' except for the last one and make sure you include the ' both befor and after the channel names
Example:

	channels: [
		'fred123',
		'alex_alpha94'
	] //End channel list

5. Make sure the bot is a modorator in each of the channels listed
Note: if you don't know how to do this then the owner of the channel can do the following command in their chat and remember to remove the ():

/mod (name of bot)

6. Either change the commands listed in the switch case or leave them as default
NOTE: the switch case should look like 
case '!multiban':
and 
case 'unmultiban':
7. Either host the bot locally or use a hosting servis like Glitch https://glitch.com/
NOTE: if you wish to host the bot locally you will need to install node which can be downloaded at https://nodejs.org/en/download/
Do the following once you complete the download:
(a) During the install make sure that NPM is being installed,
(b) when the install is complete go to the command prompt by pressing the windows key, typeing cmd and then pressing enter
(c) Then type
npm install tmi.js
(d) After this head to the directory where you have the autoBanBot.js file saved
(e) Then just click on the run.bat file to start the bot or if you wish to do this manually:
Open command prompt for the directory and type
node autoBanBot.js
If there are anny issues connecting make sure that the username and password are correct
8. Now the bot should be up and running and ready to keep your chat and the chats of your friends clear of bad users
